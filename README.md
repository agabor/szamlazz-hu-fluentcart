### Automatic Invoice Generation

2. A payment status changes to paid

The invoice will be:
- Generated on Sz치ml치zz.hu with your configured settings
- Stored in the database with order reference
- Available for download

### VAT Number Processing

If a customer provides a VAT number during checkout:
1. The plugin queries the Hungarian NAV database
2. Company information is automatically populated (name, address, VAT ID)
3. The invoice is generated with validated company data

### Manual Actions

#### Apply Shipping VAT to All Tax Rates
Use this button to apply the selected shipping VAT rate to all tax rates in FluentCart. This is useful when:
- Setting up the plugin for the first time
- Changing the shipping VAT rate
- Ensuring consistency across all tax configurations

**Note**: The button is disabled if:
- No tax rates are configured in FluentCart
- All tax rates already match the selected VAT rate

### Cache Management

The plugin caches generated PDFs, XMLs, and logs in a secure directory.

#### Current Cache Size
View the current size of cached files in the admin panel.

#### Clear Cache
Click "Clear Cache" to delete all cached files. This will:
- Remove all cached PDFs
- Remove all cached XMLs
- Remove all log files
- Free up server disk space

The cache directory will be automatically recreated when needed.

## Language Support

The admin interface is available in:
- **English** (Default)
- **Hungarian** (Magyar)

The interface language follows your WordPress language settings (Settings > General > Site Language).

## Limitations

Please be aware of the following limitations:

### VAT Rates
- Only explicit VAT rates are supported: **0%, 5%, 18%, 27%**
- Named VAT keys like AAM, TAM, TEHK are **not supported**
- Use **0%** as a substitute for special VAT categories (AAM, TAM, TEHK)

### B2B Sales
- For B2B (business-to-business) sales, the buyer **must have an EU VAT ID**
- Buyers with **local VAT ID only** are not yet supported
- The plugin validates and fetches company data from the Hungarian NAV database for EU VAT IDs

### Document Types
- Only **Invoices** can be generated
- **Receipts** (nyugta) are not supported
- **Pro forma invoices** (d칤jbek칠r콈) are not supported

### Shipping VAT Calculation
- Due to the way FluentCart calculates shipping VAT, **minor rounding errors may appear** on the web UI
- The shipping VAT on the **invoice is calculated correctly** according to Sz치ml치zz.hu standards
- This is a display-only issue and does not affect the accuracy of the generated invoice

## Troubleshooting

### Invoice Not Generated

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure your Agent API Key is correctly entered
2. **Verify Order Status**: Invoices are only generated for paid orders
3. **Check Logs**: Enable `WP_DEBUG` in your `wp-config.php` to see detailed logs
4. **Tax Configuration**: Ensure tax rates are properly configured in FluentCart

### VAT Number Issues

- VAT numbers must be valid Hungarian tax numbers
- The NAV API must be accessible
- Company data will fall back to billing address if NAV query fails

### Cache Issues

If you experience issues with cached files:
1. Go to **Settings > Sz치ml치zz.hu**
2. Scroll to "Cache Management"
3. Click "Clear Cache"
4. Test invoice generation again
